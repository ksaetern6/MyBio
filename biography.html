  <h1>Welcome to my Computing Biography</h1>
  <p>I took two Computer Science classes when I was in my community college before
  moving to Chico, then I took CSCI 211 my first semester of Chico. I learned about
  data structures like linked-lists, stacks, Binary Search Trees, and I also learned about
  pointers. I'm currently taking CSCI 311. I'm taking CSCI 110 because it is a prerequisite
  for a more advanced programming course and i wanted to learn another programming language
  other than C++.</p>
